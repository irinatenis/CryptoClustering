# Cryptocurrencies predictions | Unsupervised learning
### **Goal**: 
To create models to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
### **Tools**:
Python, Scikit-learn, hvplot
### **Steps**: 
- Used the *StandardScaler() module* from *scikit-learn* to normalize the data.
- Used the elbow method to find the best value for *k*. 
- Clustered the cryptocurrencies for the best value for *k* on the original scaled data.
- Performed a PCA on the original scaled data and reduced the features to three principal components.
- Used the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for *k*.
- Clustered the cryptocurrencies for the best value for *k* on the PCA data.
- Created a scatter plot using hvPlot.
